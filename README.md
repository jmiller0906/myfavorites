The purpose of this site was to practice creating a mobile site with several lists of favorite items. 

The home page is a simple landing page with links to About and Contact. The About page has a brief summary of the person whose page it is. The Contact is a form to contact the person who owns the page. There is a Panel that opens to a link inviting users to add their favorites. There is a page for Books, Movies, TV Shows, Restaurants, and Songs. Each page on the site has a Back button to return to the previous page.

There are buttons on each page - the buttons on the list bring the user to another page on the site. There is a sliding panel that will allow the user to submit their favorites. Each page has a Back button that returns the user to the previous page.

The URL is http://sotd.us/juliamiller2/project/index.html
